								With the “search central” design, each user could be navigating different experiences in an ad-hoc manner. Therefore, the design had to simulate a clear “transportation” to and from different experience – i.e., speaking into the phone, charting different search results, etc.

								The next challenge was creating a smart "virtual agent" without an ‘intelligence layer' present. The app would need to train a user base to interact with a unique 'bot-driven' paradigm.

						<div class="caption-right">
								The "UX Learning Curve" is a term that I often use to describe the need for user experience paradigms and the position of UI elements to remain consistent over time. Understanding the plan for future feature allows those features to be easily rolled into the existing app without forcing the user base to continually re-learn how to use the app after each release. <br><br> In the case of the smart “virtual agent,” the initial version displayed a series of well-timed ellipses animations to mimic processing time, to indicate to the user that the system is processing their request. This was so that when the "intelligence layer" in future releases is layered on, then the experience will be seamless.
